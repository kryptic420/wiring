**Wiring** is an open source electronics prototyping platform composed of a programming environment (IDE), an electronics prototyping board, documentation thoughtfully created with designers and artists in mind and a community where experts, intermediate and beginners from around the world share ideas, knowledge and their collective experience.

There are thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Wiring for learning, prototyping, and professional work production.

  * Roadmap includes support for multiple hardware architectures "Cores"
  * The current Atmel AVR 8 bit Core supports the Wiring hardware and any hardware based on the AVR ATmega processors. AVR Xmega, AVR Tiny, Texas Instruments MSP430, Microchip PIC24/32 Series and STMicroelectronics ARM Cortex M3 Cores will be available soon.
  * Simple third party hardware support integration (hardware definitions)
  * Free to download, open source and open hardware (schematics)
  * For GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
  * Over 100 libraries extend the software
  * Well [documented](http://wiring.org.co/reference/), with many [books](http://wiring.org.co/learning/books/) available

To contribute to the development, please visit [Wiring Wiki](http://wiki.wiring.co/wiki/Main_Page) to read instructions for downloading the code, building from the source, reporting and tracking bugs, and creating libraries.

The Wiring project was initiated in 2003 by the Colombian artist and designer [Hernando Barragán](http://barraganstudio.com/) while he was studying at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy, and the project is currently developed at the School of Architecture and Design at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. The Wiring IDE builds upon the Processing IDE, of the open source Processing project initiated by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab.

Using the Wiring IDE and Framework, people design and create projects which interact physically with the environment.  Furthermore, people use it to prototype electronic projects and even use the Framework in products.

In 2005, Wiring spawned another project, Arduino, which uses the Processing IDE together with a simplified version of the Wiring Framework.  Since then, the Arduino community has grown to hundreds of thousands of people, all enjoying the simplicity of the Framework on the Arduino hardware.

## Who is Wiring? ##

The core Wiring team is composed of [Hernando Barragán](http://barraganstudio.com/), [Brett Hagman](http://roguerobotics.com/) and [Alexander Brevig](http://alexanderbrevig.com/), while a small team of volunteers have been making additional contributions to Wiring.  For a full list of contributors visit http://wiring.org.co/about.html.  The current state of the project wouldn't have been possible without this assistance.
